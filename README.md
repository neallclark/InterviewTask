## Requirements
The program needs to read in a list of integers (e.g. 10 20 30 40 5 2 7)
Ask the user for a list of algorithms to use to process them (e.g. min max mean first last)
Then print the results.

## Notes
The logic of the algorithm itself isn't important (So min, max, mean, first and last are perfectly acceptable).
What we are looking for is the structure of the code (So try to include the use of Interface's and Abstract classes). Adding additional algorithms should mean very minimal change to the running of the program
